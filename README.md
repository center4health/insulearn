# Diabetes Education
This is an educational tool intended to help people with diabetes and healthcare professionals understand the relationship between insulin timing and blood glucose levels through interactive visualizations. It was created by a team of four students in collaboration with the Diabetes Design Initiative at UCSD's Design Lab: Stephanie Kim, Allison Patacsil, Stefanie Mendoza, and Vidya Raghvendra.
